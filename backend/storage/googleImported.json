        "text": "Interesting to be and see inside this storied place. The State Rooms are interesting and the chance to see the royal art collection is a real treat. I also enjoyed the special exhibition of art produced on the King Charles’s travel over the years as well as the throne room. It’s crowded but manageable. I also visited the mews with the carriages and would  recommend. My disappointment was the limited access to the garden. The website lists the Royal Gardens as one of the highlights and includes pictures of the rose garden and other select spots. Once on-site I learned that much of the garden, including the roses I hoped to see, is off-limits unless you book a special tour, which were all booked. This is not made clear on the website when booking. Also note that the amount of time they indicate for the palace tour is far too long unless you’re planning to eat in the cafe and do a lot of shopping in the gift shop. I listened to the entire tour and spent time in all of the rooms and it took me 45 minutes or so—they indicate 2 to 2.5 hours. This can be an issue if you are booking multiple timed elements at the palace or tickets elsewhere.",
